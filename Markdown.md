# Structure of Markdown instructions

## Text Style

If you want the text style to be italics, you need to write it between [*], for example: *text style in italics* or in alternative _like this_

If you want the text to be bold, write it between [**], for example: **text style in italics** or in alternative __like this__

To create a conflict i will paraphrase this line: There can be a lot of alternatives for the text style by combining [_] with [*] and it can be written in bold-italics style, for example: *__text is bold-italics__* or _**this way**_ or ___this way___ or ***like this***
