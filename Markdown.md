# Structure of Markdown instructions

## Text Style

If you want the text style to be italics, you need to write it between [*], for example: *text style in italics* or in alternative _like this_

If you want the text to be bold, write it between [**], for example: **text style in italics** or in alternative __like this__

To create a conflict i will paraphrase this line: There can be a lot of alternatives for the text style by combining [_] with [*] and it can be written in bold-italics style, for example: *__text is bold-italics__* or _**this way**_ or ___this way___ or ***like this***

## Lists

To make a dot-list do:

* element 1
* element 2

or 
+ element 3

To make a numbered list do:
1. element 1
2. element 2
3. element 3

## Images
To add an image do next:

![beautiful image](<beautiful image.jpg>)
## Sites

[def]: <Dalai Lama quote.jpg>
something went wrong, because the lists and images content was deleted when merged a branch. To fix it i will try to checkout commit the version where this error happened. Nothing changed, the lists and image sections remain null -> next I will create a branch for lists and a branch for images and will follow again the steps.
