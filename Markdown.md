# Structure of Markdown instructions

## Text Style

If you want the text style to be italics, you need to write it between [*], for example: *text style in italics* or in alternative _like this_

If you want the text to be bold, write it between [**], for example: **text style in italics** or in alternative __like this__

To create a conflict i will paraphrase this line: There can be a lot of alternatives for the text style by combining [_] with [*] and it can be written in bold-italics style, for example: *__text is bold-italics__* or _**this way**_ or ___this way___ or ***like this***

## Lists

If you want to make a dotlist start the line with [*], for examle:
* element 1
* element 2
* element 3

For a numbered list do next:
1. element 1
2. element 2
3. element 3
